# Future Web Developers

## Introduction
We are an organization of developers that all met through the [Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/) courses. We are individuals that wanted accountability and growth by sharing our knowledge and insight with one another. 

## Projects
We offer several projects that are mostly open source projects. We wanted a method in which we could simulate group projects that happen in the work force and most importantly become better developers. Within the repositories you will find a range of projects that may not be fully function but were a group effort to put together. 

Our projects are open source so your input to better our projects is possible. We want you to learn so even if you just want to change wording, fonts, organization, coloring, or whatever may be big or small we want everyone to learn by doing. So what you waiting for fork a project and dive into coding!

## Participating In Projects
We offer to anyone the ability to particpate in these projects. There are 
steps to get your particpation and code approved into our projects. If you are not an admin you will have to [fork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_FLqX3vGR4) all projects that you want to particpate in. Once you have forked a project you can edit the FORKED version of the project within an online editor such as [Github Developer](https://github.dev/github/dev) or an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). When using an IDE there is a couple ways of commiting update code to your projects. The first option is within VS Code you can connect your GitHub account to the editor and commit directly to the project fork. The second option is ideal to know and understand the technical side of using Git source control. You first must download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and once downloaded within terminal you can use these commands below.

Once you FORK a project into your repositories go into the project profile. There you find a green CODE button similar to the below image.

After you click the CODE button you'll see options appear. Select HTTPS and copy the link that it provides.
