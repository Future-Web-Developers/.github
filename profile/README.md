# Future Web Developers

## Introduction
We are an organization of developers that all met through the [Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/) courses. We are individuals that wanted accountability and growth by sharing our knowledge and insight with one another. 

## Projects
We offer several projects that are mostly open source projects. We wanted a method in which we could simulate group projects that happen in the work force and most importantly become better developers. Within the repositories you will find a range of projects that may not be fully function but were a group effort to put together. 

Our projects are open source so your input to better our projects is possible. We want you to learn so even if you just want to change wording, fonts, organization, coloring, or whatever may be big or small we want everyone to learn by doing. So what you waiting for fork a project and dive into coding!
